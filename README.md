# 604 Project 1

## September 4th Meeting
* We're all going to take a stab at it
* Include your findings/what you're looking at here so we don't overlap
* If someone adds any sort of pre-processing, let us know here.
* Noah to ask Jaylin some questions and update this

## Noah's Update
*  ~13 min per group for presentation, some of this is time for questions
* Just outline the goals of the research project, don't introduce the data
* Need to ask Johann about the project. In previous years, it was 8-12 pages (including graphs)
* No specific template, include the pdf and markdown file.

## Example Contribution (Julian)
* I looked at the relation of chumbis to Joseph
* Looks like there's a nonlinear positive relation
* Uploaded a plot to this repo comparing these two
