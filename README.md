## September 4th Meeting
* We're all going to take a stab at it
* Include your findings/what you're looking at here so we don't overlap
* If someone adds any sort of pre-processing, let us know here.
* Noah to ask Jaylin some questions and update this

## Noah's Update

## Example Contribution (Julian)
